## ⚓ Overview

“One Piece: Straw Hat Adventure” is a fully responsive fan website inspired by Eiichiro Oda’s *One Piece*, designed and developed by **Alfred Anthony Trillanes** as part of the **6WEBCS – Introduction to Web Programming for CS** final project.

The goal of this project is to recreate the immersive world of *One Piece* through engaging visuals, animations, and dynamic storytelling elements. Each page highlights key story arcs, factions, and crew members of the Straw Hat Pirates.

Built using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**, the site includes scroll-based reveals, responsive scaling for multiple devices, and animated transitions to enhance user experience and immersion.
